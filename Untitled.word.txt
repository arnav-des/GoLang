oroutine 1:

func incrementCounter() {
    counter++
}

Goroutine 2:

func printCounter() {
    fmt.Printf("Counter value: %d", counter)
}

The race condition occurs when both goroutines run simultaneously. Goroutine 1 will increment the counter, while Goroutine 2 will attempt to print the current value of the counter. Depending on which goroutine runs first, the value printed by Goroutine 2 will not be the value that was set by Goroutine 1. This is because Goroutine 2 may read the value of the counter before Goroutine 1 has had a chance to increment it.
